# RedditBot
Simple Reddit bot to perform admin functions (remove/flair/ban) based on rules (reports/votes/time)

#Usage

Edit bot_details.php with your Reddit account details and sub reddit name.

Edit bot_details.php static function rules() to ones you want. All my rules are there, so you can see the format. Delete them and make your own.

Upload to your web server and create a cron job to run the script every 2 hours or whatever.
