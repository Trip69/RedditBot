# RedditBot
Simple Reddit bot to perform admin functions (remove/flair/ban) based on rules (reports/votes/time)

#Usage

Edit bot_specific.php with your Reddit account details and sub reddit name.

Edit bot.php beneath '//Add Rules'. All my rules are there so you can see the format. Delete them and make your own.

Upload to your web server and create a cron job to run the script every 2 hours or whatever.
